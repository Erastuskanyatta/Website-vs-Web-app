### Difference Between a Web Page and a Web Application

### Introduction

It is difficult for a user to distinguish between a website and a web application. They enter the URL and get the expected outcomes.

Getting the results of what they are searching for is what matters to the end-user. How they get the results is not their business.

These products are created for the consumer by developers. Therefore, the developer must be able to tell the difference between the two. Some developers argue that the terms website and web application are similar, while others argue that they are not. Between the two types of developers who is wrong and who is correct?ðŸ˜•

I was once among those who argued that the two terms mean the same, but after research, I found out that these are two different things. In this article, I'll try to highlight some of the main differences that have helped me understand the differences between websites and web applications.

### In this tutorial we will look at:

1. [Website](#website)

2. [Web application](#web-application)

3. [Distinctions between a website and a web application](#distinctions-between-a-website-and-a-web-application)

### Website

A website is a collection of interconnected pages that may contain images, audio, or video and are linked by a single domain name.

Website is of different types. Some of them are:

1. Dating websites

2. Educational Websites

3. Social Media websites

4. Portfolio website

#### Characteristics of A website

A good web designer can Judge a site according to its appearance. One of the characteristics that will determine the success of a website is its appearance. Let's have a look at some additional website attributes.
 1. ``User friendly``- A website can be operated by almost everybody for it is easy to use and navigate.

2. ``Attractive and easy for all targeted users`` - This fixture helps in attracting all users and gives them a reason for not choosing another website to visit.

3. ``Purpose``- What is the objective of the website's appearance? A good website should provide a purpose and that purpose should be clear to the user within a short period. A user should not take much of his/her time trying to understand the reason for the appearance of a site.

   The unclear purpose may lead to a website not giving back good results.
 
4. ``High speed of loading``- Web designers should consider this fixture as not all end-users are patient. In this world of time, there is no doubt that time is a very important resource and nobody would like his/her time to go to waste. Therefore if a website loads slowly, end-users likely to look for a different website with a high speed.

    There numerous elements that factor into the loading speed of a website, yet everything starts with the hosting quality. Always choose a host that loads first and keep end-users happy.

5. ``Secure``- A good website provides security for both end-users and designers 

#### What is the importance of a website

1. ``It provides self-service customer support in Business``- If your website support Q&A post, then you can provide a forum where user can have questions about your goods among themselves. Other users can provide answers to the questions.

   This can make things a lot quicker for your clients and make your client service office more effective.

2. ``Website shows Professionalism``- Imagine you are dealing with a supplier whom you want to buy goods from, and this supplier doesn't have a website. I am very sure you would not have a second thought looking for another supplier with a website. This gives an impression that that supplier or company is not well managed.

   Why would an end-user purchase from a supplier or company without a website? Most end-users have a bad opinion of suppliers without a website and they consider them as unprofessional.

3. ``It gives opportunities abroad``- If you have a website, you create an opportunity for everyone worldwide to find you. If you're selling your product online, you end up having more market compared to a business person selling locally. This will in turn increase the profit. 

### Web application

A web application is a program component that can be accessed via a browser and is linked to a database. A web application contains both functional and interactive elements.

Unlike websites, web apps are hard to create(because they are very customized) and require an experienced team.

Below are examples of web application:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en)

- [G-mail](https://mail.google.com/)

- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

#### Characteristics of A web Application

1. ``Accessibility``- A good web app is available and usable by a maximum number of people. The web application should be accessible to people with disabilities.

2. ``Storage system`` -Should have a good database for storing designers' and end-users information.

3. ``Easily expanded``- Business keeps on expanding as time passes by. It is simple to update a web app as only servers are to be upgraded.

4. `Cross-platform`- Web app can run in any Operating system using different browsers

#### What is the importance of a web Application

1. `Security`- All organizations should know about security dangers with their applications. Web applications ensure sites and programs are secure since they are designed with more privacy and a high level of security. 

 2.  ``Easy to use`` â€“ End users can access them from any device at any time. 

3.  Data access is simple because they are used on both mobile and desktop computers. 

### Distinctions between a website and a web application

#### 1. The user's interaction

There is no functionality on the website. The end-user only view the visual content but cannot interact with it. 

On the other hand, the web app allows the end-user to interact one on one by giving out details to enable him to log in or filling out a form.

#### 2. Reasons for creation

 The website is mostly meant for the universe. This means that information can be accessed by anyone publicly.

Unlike a website, the web app is meant for interaction with the end-users. This means that the end-user must provide some details to use a web app. Without the required details, data might not be available.

#### 3. Code Deployment

On the website, small changes do not require a full re-accumulation and deployment. You need to refresh/update the HTML code and all that will be updated. 

Code deployment in the web app is quite different. Here, you need to re-compile and re-deploy the app after making any change.

#### 4. Authentication

On a website, end-users authentication is not mandatory. The user may give some details at wish if they are willing to get any updates from the website.

 On the other hand, Web applications need validation as they offer a lot more extensive extent of alternatives and usefulness than a website. To access your account you must provide details like username and password that verify ownership.

#### 5. Development

Developing a website is not complicated. With the knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS` and maybe `JavaScript` you can develop a full working website. Sometimes it only requires a single frontend developer to do the task.

Furthermore, you can just use a template to develop a website. This means that even a young developer can easily develop a simple working website.

For a web app, development is quite different from that of a website, here, you need the knowledge of both frontend and backend to develop a working web app. For the backend part, there is a variety of technology to be used. Either ``Python``, `PHP`, `Ruby` etc. Choosing the backend technology depends on the developer. The web application is working for a whole development team.  

#### 6. Task and Complexity

While a website shows the collected information and data on a particular page, a web app is quite complicated and functions higher compared to the website.

### Conclusion

Unlike developing a website that is a bit simple and less complicated, a web application needs more knowledge and experience for it to be created.

From the above discussion, I believe now that you can tell the difference between website and web app and what you interact with on daily basis.
